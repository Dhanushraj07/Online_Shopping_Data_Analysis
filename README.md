## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark** (PySpark)
- **Databricks** for running the project
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
- **CSV** for input/output data

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and handling null values
- Calculating total sales per product
- Visualizing the top 5 products by total sales with pie charts
- Saving results as CSV files and charts

## Files

- `online_shopping_analysis.py`: Main PySpark script for the analysis.
- `online_shopping_data.csv`: Sample dataset used in the project.
- `pie_chart_top_5_products.png`: Pie chart showing the top 5 products by sales.
